        <h1>Rubber Duck</h1>
        <p>
        On a drive back home I found myself desperately trying to hold onto
        an idea and not forget it, I tried to get siri to record a voice 
        memo, but that failed, then I tried to call myself to record it as
        a voicemail but that just returned user busy. As I was stuck trying 
        to remember this thought my mind started to drift.
        </p>
        <p>
        As I thought about voice memos and how they feel more natural in 
        terms of flow compared to that of note-taking and I came up with these 
        main points:
        <ul>
            <li>I want to verbalise my ideas rather than write them</li>
            <li>I prefer to read back over my ideas than listen</li>
            <li>I feel just taking to your phone doesn't help this flow</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        With these points I came up with this idea of combining the developers
        current habit of taking over bugs with a rubber duck with the concept
        of voice memos.
